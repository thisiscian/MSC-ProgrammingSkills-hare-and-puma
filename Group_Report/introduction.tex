A pair of coupled PDEs can be used to model a predator prey model, like
that of hares and pumas on an island.
An example set of PDEs is
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial{H}}{\partial{t}} &= rH - aHP + k\,{\nabla^2}H \\
  \frac{\partial{P}}{\partial{t}} &= bHP - mP + l\,{\nabla^2}P
\end{align*}
Where $H$ and $P$ are 2D fields representing the densities of hares and pumas
at a given point in space,
$t$ is time,
$r$ is the rate of birth of hares,
$a$ is the rate of predation of hares by pumas,
$k$ is the diffusion coefficient of the hares,
$b$ is the rate of birth of pumas (dependant on the number of hares to
    feed their young),
$m$ is the rate of death of pumas (by old age) and
$l$ is the diffusion coefficient of the pumas.

This set of PDEs can be discretized to be solved numerically.
This can be done by defining a grid of points where the fields are
defined and the values of the fields at a time $t + \Delta{t}$ can
be found using the following update routines

\begin{align*}
  H^{t+\Delta{t}}_{i,j} &= H^{t}_{i,j}
       + \Delta{t}(
           rH^{t}_{i,j} - a H^{t}_{i,j} P^{t}_{i,j}
           + k (
             (H^{t}_{i-1,j} + H^{t}_{i+1,j} + H^{t}_{i,j-1} + H^{t}_{i,j+1})
             -N_{i,j} H^{t}_{i,j}
           )
         ) \\
%
  P^{t+\Delta{t}}_{i,j} &= P^{t}_{i,j}
       + \Delta{t}(
           b H^{t}_{i,j} P^{t}_{i,j} - mP^{t}_{i,j}
           + l (
             (P^{t}_{i-1,j} + P^{t}_{i+1,j} + P^{t}_{i,j-1} + P^{t}_{i,j+1})
             -N_{i,j} P^{t}_{i,j}
           )
         )
\end{align*}

A program was designed and written to do just this, where a user could
specify the value of each variable, and the program would output some
data on the fields at particular intervals.

A team of three was formed to undertake this task.
Given the relative simplicity of the problem, and the group members'
maths and programming backgrounds, it was felt that any more than three
members would spread the work too thinly.
