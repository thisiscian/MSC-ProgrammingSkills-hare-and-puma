\section{Debugging}
For the most part debugging was done by the group member responsible for the part of the code where the code was found.
This was done as they were the most familiar with it and thus were the most likely to know what the problem was.
There were a number of occasions where the group did work together to try and resolve bugs that were found.
It was ensured that whenever a bug was found, a test would be written to catch it so that in future it would be noticed if it re-occurred.
Ordinarily the causes of the bugs were found using print statements as most bugs found during the project were quite small and the problem was almost always immediately obvious.
It is possible that some of the bugs would have been found more easily if debugging tools were used but due to the overhead associated with learning the use of most tools it was not worthwhile for this project.

The \texttt{Memcheck} tool included with \texttt{Valgrind} was used however in order to check that the memory was being allocated and deallocated correctly and that no memory leaks were occurring.
This was found to be this case so no further action was required.
