This documents the agreed conventions
=====================================

The C conventions as documented at:
http://fxa.noaa.gov/manuals/codingGuidelines.html

with emphasis on:
UPPERCASE_IDENTIFIERS for #defined constants
UpperMixedCase for user defined types (enumerations, classes, structs, unions etc.)
lowerMixedCase for local variable names, function names, formal parameter names

files will be named with .cpp
two space tabs will be used
curly brackets will be on a new line at the same indentation as the function they are for
