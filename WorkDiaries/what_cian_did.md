What Cian Did With His Time
===========================

--------------
- discussed what tasks we would split up
- I am doing the output
- created a very simple "output.h" and "output.cpp" system to write two arrays to files
- considered using "latitude" and "longitude" instead of the lengthy "horizontalPosition" and "verticalPosition" but decided that they were too complicated
